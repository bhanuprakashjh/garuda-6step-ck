/**
 * @file hal_ptg.h
 * @brief V5.0 Peripheral Trigger Generator for per-sector BEMF sampling.
 *
 * The PTG is a core-independent state machine. We use it to fire an
 * interrupt at a hardware-exact delay from each PWM trigger so the BEMF
 * comparator GPIO can be sampled at an offset that software polling
 * (SCCP1, ADC ISR) cannot reach. Zero CPU jitter.
 *
 * Gate: FEATURE_V5_PTG_ZC. When 0, every function is a no-op and the
 * PTG module stays off. When 1, HAL_PTG_Start runs the queue and
 * _PTG0Interrupt fires at (valley + PTGT0LIM ticks) every PWM cycle.
 *
 * A prior V3-era attempt lived in this same file with wrong opcodes
 * (confirmed against DS70005349 Table 24-1). It has been removed;
 * the V3 PTG path was never proven on bench.
