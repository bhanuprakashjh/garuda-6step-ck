/**
 * @file hal_ic_dma.h
 * @brief Dual-CCP + DMA shadow input capture ring (experiment).
 *
 * Gated by FEATURE_IC_DMA_SHADOW. When OFF, this file produces no code
 * and the production path is untouched. When ON, the live CCP2 IC path
 * in hal_ic.c is stubbed (its <1% timestamp contribution is negligible
 * and already dominated by raw poll), and this module takes exclusive
 * ownership of CCP2 and CCP5 to produce hardware-precise ZC timestamps
 * in circular RAM rings via DMA0 and DMA1 — with zero CPU involvement
 * per capture.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   CCP2 (MOD=0b0010, falling edge)  → captures every rising BEMF ZC
 *   CCP5 (MOD=0b0001, rising edge)   → captures every falling BEMF ZC
 *     (ATA6847 comparator is inverted)
 *
 *   DMA0 triggers on SCCP2 capture (CHSEL=0x0C), source=&CCP2BUFL,
 *     destination=dmaRingRising[] (128 entries, circular wrap),
 *     one 16-bit word per trigger.
 *
 *   DMA1 triggers on SCCP5 capture (CHSEL=0x16), source=&CCP5BUFL,
 *     destination=dmaRingFalling[] (128 entries, circular wrap),
 *     one 16-bit word per trigger.
 *
 *   Same floating-phase RP pin routed to both ICM2R and ICM5R each
 *   commutation (PPS selectors are independent, no conflict).
 *
 *   Both timers free-running forever. CCPON never toggled after init.
 *   _CCP2IE and _CCP5IE remain 0 always — DMA owns the FIFO drain.
 *
 * Shadow-only: HAL_ZcDma_Probe() is called from RecordZcTiming AFTER
 * the poll path has committed lastZcTickHR. It scans the appropriate
 * ring for captures in [windowOpenHR, currentHR] and reports deltas
 * against the poll timestamp and the predicted ZC. The results live
 * in GARUDA_DATA_T::dmaShadow and are exposed via GSP telemetry.
 * The live scheduler is never affected.
